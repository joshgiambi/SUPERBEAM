## Git Commit Conventions

When creating git commits, ALWAYS use conventional commit format for regulatory traceability:

Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>

Types:
- feat: New feature or capability
- fix: Bug fix or defect correction
- refactor: Code restructuring without behavior change
- docs: Documentation only
- perf: Performance improvement
- test: Adding or updating tests

Scopes (use the most relevant):
- rt-structure: RT Structure Sets, contours, ROIs
- rt-dose: RT Dose display and calculations
- rt-plan: RT Plan, beams, MLC
- dvh: Dose-Volume Histogram
- fusion: Image fusion and registration
- viewer: Viewport, display, rendering
- contour: Drawing tools, pen, brush
- ai: SAM, SegVol, predictions
- import: DICOM import/upload
- ui: User interface, panels, dialogs

Examples:
- fix(rt-structure): Handle database-only structure sets in auto-save
- feat(dvh): Add constraint evaluation panel
- refactor(viewer): Simplify viewport state management

For medium/high risk changes (rt-dose, rt-plan, ai, rt-structure), include a brief description of what was fixed and why in the commit body.

After significant feature completions or bug fixes, mention that regulatory docs will auto-update on commit.
